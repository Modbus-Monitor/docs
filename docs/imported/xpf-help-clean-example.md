## Next Steps

This clean Markdown example demonstrates the proper structure for documentation that will generate good search results. The key principles applied:

### ✅ **What Makes This Better**

1. **Clear Hierarchy**: Proper heading structure (H1, H2, H3, H4)
2. **Short Paragraphs**: 1-3 sentences per paragraph maximum
3. **Bullet Lists**: Break down complex information into digestible points
4. **Clean Images**: Simple image syntax with descriptive alt text
5. **Meaningful Links**: Descriptive link text instead of "click here"
6. **Consistent Formatting**: Bold for emphasis, code blocks for technical terms

### 🔍 **Search Result Examples**

With this clean structure, search results would show:
- `"The Modbus Monitor XPF application is a versatile tool for facilitating communication between..."`
- `"One of the standout features of Modbus Monitor XPF is its dual functionality..."`
- `"The ribbon interface provides organized access to all application features..."`

Instead of the HTML mess:
- `"elementor elementor-18 elementor-location-header elementor-type header elementor-id 18..."`

### 📝 **For Your Rewriting Work**

When you convert the other imported documents, follow this pattern:

1. **Extract actual content** from HTML markup
2. **Create logical heading hierarchy** (# ## ### ####)
3. **Break long paragraphs** into 1-2 sentence chunks
4. **Use lists** for multi-step processes or feature lists
5. **Add descriptive image alt text** for screenshots
6. **Remove HTML artifacts** (class names, divs, etc.)

This approach will naturally solve the search result problem by giving MkDocs clean, well-structured content to index and display.
